## Introduction {.unnumbered}

In brief, `Quarto` allows you to combine various types of content in a document (text, code, equations, images, graphics, etc.) and then compile it all into a single document, such as HTML, PDF, etc. The term used in the `Quarto` environment for this compilation is very poetically called **knitting**.

## Objectives {.unnumbered}

Today, we will explore the data from the [**Palmerpenguins**](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins "palmerpenguins R package") package to answer the following questions:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
***What is the relationship between flipper length and body mass?<br />Does this relationship vary between species?***
:::

But first, let's get a grasp of the basics and create our first Quarto document!

<br/>

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Exercise 1 - Quarto basics {.unnumbered}

1.  Create a new Quarto document (`.qmd`) by clicking on *`File > New File > Quarto Document`*
2.  Add a title and author in the YAML[^1] section at the top of the document
3.  Click `Render` to render/knit your document. Observe the result. What type of document is this?
4.  Modify the YAML header to change the output format to docs
5.  Re-render your document
6.  What about PDF?

[^1]: Yet Another Markup Language, corresponding the the metadata of a Quarto document

<br/>

## Including common content {#include-content}

The most common thing you are likely to do in your Quarto document is text formatting. The language used for this is called **Markdown**. It is a fairly basic language but allows you to intuitively perform most basic formatting tasks.

> Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. - [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy)

<br/>

### Text formats {#txt-formats}

Formatting text is easy and follows a common structure by surrounding the text with special characters:

``` markdown
*italic* **bold** ~~strikeout~~ `code`

superscript^2^ subscript~2~

[underline]{.underline} [small caps]{.smallcaps}
```

> *italic* **bold** ~~strikeout~~ `code`
>
> superscript^2^ subscript~2~
>
> [underline]{.underline} [small caps]{.smallcaps}

<br/>

### Sections {#sections}

Sections are added to a document using different numbers of `#`:

``` markdown
# 1st Level Header

## 2nd Level Header

### 3rd Level Header
```

<br/>

### Lists {#lists}

``` markdown
-   Bulleted list item 1

-   Item 2

    -   Item 2a

    -   Item 2b

1.  Numbered list item 1

2.  Item 2

    i)  Sub-item 1
    
        A.  Sub-sub-item 1
```

> -   Bulleted list item 1
>
> -   Item 2
>
>     -   Item 2a
>
>     -   Item 2b
>
> 1.  Numbered list item 1
>
> 2.  Item 2
>
>     i)  sub-item 1
>
>         A. sub-sub-item 1

::: callout-caution
Markdown is case-sensitive, meaning you need to format the text correctly for it to recognise a sub-item, for example.
:::

<br/>

### Links {#links}

Add a link with angle brackets for displaying the raw URL, or use a combination of square and round brackets to define the link text and URL:

-   the text to appear in square brackets
-   followed by the URL in round brackets

``` markdown
<https://quarto.org/>

A link to the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/).
```

> <https://quarto.org/>
>
> A link to the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/).

<br/>

### Images {#images}

Add an image using `![](path/image.png)`.

You can add a caption easily within the brackets as such `![Cool image](path/image.png)`

```

## Tip for local files

Use relative file paths rather than absolute file paths - other people won’t share the same absolute file path as you!

File paths are relative to where the Quarto document is!

## Before the exercise

1.  Download the [penguins-template.qmd](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/ellfran-7/repro-research-workshop/blob/main/templates/penguins-template.qmd) zip

2.  Unzip the downloaded folder and, if you want, rename the unzipped folder on your computer (something like "`cs-workshop-2025`")

3.  Now, open the `penguins-template.qmd` file in Rstudio

4.  Once Rstudio is up and running, copy and paste `install.packages("palmerpenguins")` into the **Console** and run it once
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Exercise 2 - Markdown basics {.unnumbered}

1.  Open the `penguins-template.qmd` file in RStudio

2.  **Add a Level 2 header** titled "**Data Overview**" after the existing content in the file

3.  **Copy and paste** the following text into the file:

    ``` markdown
    The penguins dataframe contains 344 observations of penguins.
    It includes several qualitative variables, including the following:
    - Sex of the penguins
    - Island where they are found
    - Species to which they belong
    The represented species are: Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adélie.
    ```

4.  **Modify the text** so that the final rendering looks like this:

    > The `penguins` dataframe contains 344 observations of penguins. It includes several qualitative variables, including the following:
    >
    > -   *Sex* of the penguins
    > -   **Island** where they are found
    > -   ***Species*** to which they belong
    >
    > The represented species are : **Chinstrap**, **Gentoo** et **Adélie**.

5.  **Add the online image** found at this [link](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/figures/lter_penguins.png) to your document, then add **a caption to this image**

6.  **Render** your document. Observe the changes
:::

<br/>

## R Code in a "Chunk" {#code-chunks}

Code chunks are the main way of including executable R code in a document.

They always start with three backticks, followed by the an r in curly brackets.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
2 + 2
```

The result of the code is outputted after the chunk, as you can see.

A more coherent example:

```{r}
#| echo: fenced

library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)
```

```{r}
#| echo: fenced

ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_density() +
  theme_bw()
```

<br/>

### Code chunk options {#code-chunk-opt}

We can change the chunk execution options so that the code *messages do not show* with `warning: false`.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| warning: false

ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_density() +
  theme_bw()
```

Most common execution options:

| Option | Description if `____: true` |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `eval` | Evaluate the code chunk |
| `echo` | Include the source code in output |
| `output` | Include the results of executing the code |
| `warning` | Include warnings/messages in the output |
| `error` | Include errors in the output (errors won't halt document processing) |
| `include` | Prevent any output (code or results) from being included |

<br/>

### Code chunk options: `code-fold` {#code-fold}

Instead of simply removing the code, we can choose to *include code but have it hidden* by default.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true


ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_density() +
  theme_bw()
```

<br/>

### Figure options: `fig-` {#fig-option}

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| warning: false
#| fig-align: center 
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-asp: 0.9
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of bill depth sizes"

ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_density() +
  theme_bw()
```

<br/>

### Cross-referencing: `label` {#label}

We can add internal links for cross-referencing using `label`.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| warning: false
#| fig-align: center 
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-asp: 0.9
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of bill depth sizes"
#| label: fig-billdepth

ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_density() +
  theme_bw()
```

``` markdown
Many penguins in the dataset seem to have a bill depth between 18 and 19mm ([@fig-billdepth]).
```

> Many penguins seem to have bill depths between 18 and 19mm ([@fig-billdepth]).

<br/>

### Tables (`tbl-`) and equations (`eq-`)

Table options are similar to those of figures, but instead of `fig-` for some options, it is `tbl-`:

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| tbl-align: center 
#| tbl-cap: "First 5 rows and columns of the penguins dataset"
#| label: tbl-pengdata

knitr::kable(head(penguins[,1:5]))
```

For equations, it is slightly different for cross-referencing.

``` markdown
$$
E = mc^2
$$ {#eq-linear}
```

$$
E = mc^2
$$ {#eq-linear}

``` markdown
According to the @eq-linear, the relationship between energy and mass is directly proportional.
```

> According to the @eq-linear, the relationship between energy and mass is directly proportional.

<br/>

### Inline code {#inline-code}

You can include executable expressions inside the markdown (text) by enclosing the expression in `` `r ` ``

``` 
The penguins dataset is composed of `` `r nrow(penguins)` `` observations.
```

> The penguins dataset is composed of `r nrow(penguins)` observations.

<br/> <br/>

## Exercise 3 - Code chunks and outputs {.unnumbered}

1.  **Add a code block** to generate a table showing the first 5 rows of the `penguins` dataframe using the `knitr::kable()` function. **Render** the document.

    ::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
    ## Hint

    For those not familiar with R, unfold the following, copy and paste into the document, and render:

    ```{r}
    #| code-fold: true
    #| eval: false
    knitr::kable(head(penguins))
    ```
    :::

2.  **Add a second code block to generate a figure** (using R base or `ggplot2`) to explore the relationship between the body mass of penguins and the length of their flippers, as well as the differences between species. **Render** the document.

    ::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
    ## Hint

    For those not familiar with R, unfold the following, copy and paste into the document and render:

    ```{r}
    #| code-fold: true
    #| eval: false
    g <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
                                  y = body_mass_g)) +
          geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species), 
                     size = 2, 
                     alpha = 0.7) + 
          scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) + 
          labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)", 
               y = "Body mass (g)", 
               color = "Penguin species", 
               shape = "Penguin species") + 
          theme_minimal()

    g
    ```
    :::

3.  **Add the following options to the code chunk**, one by one. **Render** the document after each modification and observe the changes:

    a.  `echo: false`

    b.  `warning: false`

4.  Just below the figure, **provide a description** of the relationship between the two variables, both overall and for each species.

5.  **Modify the size of the figure** using the following options, one by one. **Render** the document after each modification and observe how the figure changes:

    a.  `fig-width: 10`

    b.  `fig-height: 3`

    c.  `out-width: "100%"`

    d.  `out-width: "20%"`

6.  **Add a label** to the figure with the prefix `fig-`.

7.  **Add a caption** to the figure using the `fig-cap` chunk option. In the description written in at **4.**, **add the cross-reference** to this figure. **Render** your document.
