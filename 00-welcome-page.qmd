## Brief Workshop Overview

The workshop will be divided into two parts:

1.  Reproducible Research: An Open Discussion
2.  Literate Programming with Quarto: A Small but Impactful Step

**Part 1** will be discussion-based, focusing on the concept of reproducibility, its importance, and the factors contributing to non-reproducibility. There will be practical work also. No prior coding or bioinformatics knowledge is needed here.

**Part 2** is hands-on and involves practical work using specific informatic tools. To participate fully, youâ€™ll need to download or update these tools in advance. Donâ€™t worryâ€”theyâ€™re free and easy to set up! Let's go!

To ensure everything runs smoothly on the day of the workshop, weâ€™ll need to set up a few things beforehand. Visit the [Pre-workshop instructions](01-pre-work.qmd) to set everything up for the day! ðŸ§™
