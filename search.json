It originated from discussions with my friend and lab member J√©r√©my Bacon. This seminar is a shorter, less hands-on version of the workshop I conducted in February of this year‚Äîyou can explore the full materials and site here.\nRecognising the ongoing need to share knowledge about reproducible research, I decided to organise this session to contribute what I know on the topic (or what I think I know üëΩ). While I don‚Äôt claim to be an expert, every little helps. My hope is that this seminar sparks enough interest to encourage others to explore and strive toward more reproducible, transparent, and accessible research practices."

We‚Äôll explore the benefits of working reproducibly‚Äîboth for others and for ourselves‚Äîexamine the factors that limit or discourage reproducible practices, and discuss practical, incremental solutions for becoming more reproducible in our work. A seminar on this subject gains value through interaction and engagement from the audience, so I‚Äôve woven discussion questions throughout the presentation to encourage exchange and reflection."
