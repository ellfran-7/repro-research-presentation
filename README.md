## Birthright of the workshop

This workshop was designed for members of my lab, the Laboratoire des Environnements Continentaux (LIEC), spanning both the Metz and Nancy sites. Recognising a need to share knowledge about reproducible research, I decided to organize this session to contribute what I know on the topic (or what I think I know :alien:). While I donâ€™t claim to be an expert, every little helps. My hope is that this workshop sparks enough interest to encourage others to explore and strive toward more reproducible, transparent, and accessible research practices.

## Inspiration

The workshop's structure and certain content elements were inspired by: 

* the [Introduction to Quarto](https://github.com/rdatatoolbox/course-quarto) presentation from the [**_Data Toolbox for Reproducible Research in Ecology_**](https://rdatatoolbox.github.io) organized by the 
[FRB-CESAB](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/about-the-foundation/le-cesab/) 
and the 
[GdR EcoStat](https://sites.google.com/site)

* the [Introduction to Reproducibility](https://www.repro4everyone.org/resources/intro-reproducibility) presentation created by [Repro4Everyone](https://www.repro4everyone.org/)

* Nicole Rennie's [Introduction to Quarto](https://nrennie.rbind.io/training-intro-to-quarto/)
