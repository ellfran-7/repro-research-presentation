## Background of the presentation

This presentation was designed for a weekly seminar series at the [LEHNA](https://umr5023.univ-lyon1.fr/) laboratory. It originated from discussions with my friend and lab member [Jérémy Bacon](https://umr5023.univ-lyon1.fr/annuaire/details/1/535-bacon-jeremy). This seminar is a shorter, less hands-on version of the workshop I conducted in February of this year—you can explore the full materials and site [here](https://ellfran-7.github.io/repro-research-workshop/). 

Recognising the ongoing need to share knowledge about reproducible research, I decided to organise this session to contribute what I know on the topic (or what I think I know :alien:). While I don't claim to be an expert, every little helps. My hope is that this seminar sparks enough interest to encourage others to explore and strive toward more reproducible, transparent, and accessible research practices.


## Description

The presentation focuses on introducing the what, where, when, and how of reproducible research. We'll explore the benefits of working reproducibly---both for others and for ourselves---examine the factors that limit or discourage reproducible practices, and discuss practical, incremental solutions for becoming more reproducible in our work.
A seminar on this subject gains value through interaction and engagement from the audience, so I've woven discussion questions throughout the presentation to encourage exchange and reflection.


## Inspiration

The workshop's structure and certain content elements were inspired by: 

* the [Introduction to Quarto](https://github.com/rdatatoolbox/course-quarto) presentation from the [**_Data Toolbox for Reproducible Research in Ecology_**](https://rdatatoolbox.github.io) organized by the 
[FRB-CESAB](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/about-the-foundation/le-cesab/) 
and the 
[GdR EcoStat](https://sites.google.com/site)

* the [Introduction to Reproducibility](https://www.repro4everyone.org/resources/intro-reproducibility) presentation created by [Repro4Everyone](https://www.repro4everyone.org/)

* Nicole Rennie's [Introduction to Quarto](https://nrennie.rbind.io/training-intro-to-quarto/)
