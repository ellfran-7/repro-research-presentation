## Exercise 1 - Quarto basics

1.  Create a new Quarto HTML document using *File \> New File \> Quarto Document*
2.  Add a title and author in the YAML section at the top of the document
3.  Render the document
4.  Modify the YAML header to change the output format to docs
5.  Re-render your document
6.  What about PDF?

## Exercise 2 - Markdown basics

::: callout-note
Before this exercise: 

1. Download the '[penguins-template.qmd](https://github.com/ellfran-7/repro-research-workshop/tree/main/templates/penguins-template.qmd)' 
2. Move the file into a New Folder on your computer (call it something like "`cs-workshop-2025`")
2. Now, open the `penguins-template.qmd` in Rstudio
3. Once Rstudio up and running, copy and paste `install.packages("palmerpenguins")` into the **Console** and run it.
:::

1.  Open the `penguins-template.qmd` file in RStudio

2.  **Add a Level 2 header** titled "**Data Overview**" after the existing
    content in the file

3.  **Copy and paste** the following text into the file:

    ``` markdown
    The `penguins` dataframe contains 344 observations of penguins.
    It includes several qualitative variables, including the following:
    - Sex of the penguins
    - Island where they are found
    - Species to which they belong
    The represented species are: Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Ad√©lie.
    ```
  
4.  **Modify the text** so that the final rendering looks like this,
    with the value 344 inserted using **inline code**:

    > The penguins `penguins` contains 344 observations of penguins. It
    > includes several qualitative variables, including the following:
    >
    > -   *Sex* of the penguins
    > -   **Island** where they are found
    > -   ***Species*** to which they belong
    >
    > The represented species are : **Chinstrap**, **Gentoo** et
    > **Ad√©lie**.

5.  **Add the image** `three-penguins.png` to your document, then add
    **a caption for this image**.


## Exercise 3 - Code blocks and ouputs

1.  **Add a code block** to generate a table showing the first 5 rows of
    the `penguins` dataframe using the `knitr::kable()` function.

::: callout-tip
For those not familiar with R, unfold the following, copy and paste into the document, and render:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
knitr::kable(head(penguins))
```
:::

2.  **Add a second code block to generate a figure** (using R base or
    `ggplot2`) to explore the relationship between the body mass of
    penguins and the length of their flippers, as well as the
    differences between species.

::: callout-tip
For those not familiar with R, unfold the following, copy and paste
into the document and render:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
g <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
                              y = body_mass_g)) +
      geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species), 
                 size = 2, 
                 alpha = 0.7) + 
      scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) + 
      labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)", 
           y = "Body mass (g)", 
           color = "Penguin species", 
           shape = "Penguin species") + 
      theme_minimal()

g
```
:::

3.  **Add the following options to the code chunk**, one by one. Generate the document after each modification and observe the changes:

    a.  `echo: false`
    b.  `warning: false`

4.  Just below the figure, **provide a description** of the relationship between the two variables, both overall and for each species.

5.  **Modify the size of the figure** using the following options, one by one. Re-render the document after each modification and describe how the figure changes:

    a.  `fig-width: 10`
    b.  `fig-height: 3`
    c.  `out-width: "100%"`
    d.  `out-width: "20%"`

6.  **Add a label** to the figure with the prefix `fig-`.

7.  **Add a caption** to the figure using the `fig-cap` chunk option. Re-render one last time.


Well done! You've just created your first Quarto report üéâ !
